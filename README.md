# Simple Quiz

This is a simple quiz I wrote to learn a bit of Svelte using the same template `create-svelte` provides to you out-of-the-box

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Testing

I wrote a single test that should secure this app on running on most browsers.

```bash
# run npx playwrite install if you are getting errors.
npx run test
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
